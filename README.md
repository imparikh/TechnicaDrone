# TechnicaDrone
Pollock drone for Technica 2015

This software used nodejs to get data points from a server that allowed users to click on a canvas where they wanted the drone
to drop paint. Then, the drone went and did it. This was demonstrated at the Technica all-ladies hackathon to support the event. 

Tracking software done with python and OpenCV.

Automated runs done with Node.js
